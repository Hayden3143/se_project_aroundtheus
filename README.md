**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Functionality**

The webpage features a profile section that displays a profile picture, name, edit button, description, and an add button. Additionally, it includes a cards section that contains a list of cards, each showcasing an image, title, and like button for different locations. The design is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes to provide a user-friendly interface on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used**

The project utilizes HTML5 to provide the structure of the webpage and CSS3 for styling, including layout, colors, and responsive design. It employs CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to create flexible and responsive layouts. Media queries are used to adjust styles for different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design.
Javascript used to provide funcationality to design through the use of propfile edit modal and refactor of Cards list
